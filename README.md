* These are some notebooks I put together for the first meeting of the
Portand Julia Users meetup (https://www.meetup.com/Portland-Julia-Users/).

* The images of Chinese characters used in the fourth notebook were collected by
Ryan Harper (https://github.com/kimrharper) from the web site
http://char.iis.sinica.edu.tw for a series of meetups of the Portland Data
Science Group.

* For the models, I borrowed heavily from Flux's model zoo:
 https://github.com/FluxML/model-zoo/tree/master/vision/mnist.

* I also borrowed from the 60-minute Flux blitz for the first notebook:
https://github.com/FluxML/model-zoo/pull/77
